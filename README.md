## Hi there, I am Fatima Ghafoor! 👋

I’m a Software Engineer currently working as a Freelancer on Freelancer.com and Fiverr. My work spans both creative and technical sides, allowing me to bring a complete approach to projects.

My core area is Android Development using Java, Web Development using C# & ASP.NET MVC supported by a solid understanding of SQL. I focus on building reliable, well-structured applications with clean code and smooth functionality.

Alongside development, I have a strong command of design. Over the years, I’ve worked on brand identities, websites, and posters creating visuals that align with each project’s tone and purpose.
